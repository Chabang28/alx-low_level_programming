## Project Description 

+ This project was created just as instructed by the author of the program.
+ It contains tasks and quizzes that help assist the C programming language learner.
+ Inside this directory are the various files for the tasks that the learner was asked to come up with.
+ The files here are the programs or solutions to the various tasks respectfully.
+ **NOTE**: *This directly and all of its contents exist for learning purposes.*

## Commands

These are some commands you need to take note of and understand to familiarise yourself with this project.

**NOTE**: Use the "man <command_name> " in your terminal to better understand how these commands work

## Tasks

**NOTE**: Sorry, This section is still in progress and will be updated as time goes on.

## Notes

These are the notes I gathered during the accomplishments of these tasks;

**POINTERS**

- Pointers are variables in programming that store memory addresses. 
- In other words, a pointer is a variable that "points" to the memory location of another variable.
- Instead of directly holding a value, a pointer holds the address where the value is stored in memory
- Pointers are commonly used in programming languages like C and C++ to manipulate memory and access data indirectly.
- They allow efficient memory management and provide flexibility in working with complex data structures.

**How To Declare Pointers.**

- In C, You are always going to declare something.
- Anytime uou are declaring something in C, you meed to specify the data type of interest. i.e int, char, float 
- Never forget that the pointer is just a container
- It contains an address that points to something else.
- You must prefix the variable with an asterisk. To tdll that the specific variable is just there to store an address. 


**NOTE**: Sorry, This section is still in progress and will be updated as time goes on.

## Installation

This project requires you to have these necessary installations to function appropriately.

- The latest version of UBUNTU
- A compiler ( GCC - GNU Compiler Collection ) 
- You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option 
- Betty Linter (also known as "Betty Style," refers to a coding style guide and linter for the C programming language.)
- **Refer To This Link To Install The Betty Linter:**

## Usage

+ This project and all of its contents are for learning purposes.
+ Some of these files contain basic scripts on how to achieve certain results.

## Contributions

+ This repository and all of its contents are works/solutions that I came up with for the tasks assigned to me as a learner of the C language.
+ Contributions are allowed and will be taken into consideration.
+ With that being said please let me know if I missed something.
+ I am up for corrections.
